# Faster Mixing 

Lets users set their mix time per item via config file :)




## How to use

In order to use this mod make sure you do following things:

```bash
  Have latest version of melonloader installed
  ```
  ```bash
  Use Schedule I alternate version (right click Schedule I in steam library, choose betas, choose either alternate beta or alternate)
```
```bash
unzip the contents in the mods folder and edit the "configFasterMixing.json" to set mixing time to your preference
```


## Edit JSON File
As specified before, you'll want to edit the JSON file to set the mixing time exactly to your preference. 

Here's the different variables to change:

MixTimePerItem: Whatever value this is will be the time it takes for each item to mix. By default this is 1, meaning for 20 items it'll take 20 seconds

InstantMixing: Setting this option to true will enable instant mixing. This will also override other variables so if this is true the others won't matter, mixing will always be instant.

MixTimeForAnything: If you set this to something over 0, it will override whatever MixTimePerItem is and instead allow you to put whatever time any mix takes, despite the quantity. Set this to 1, and 20 items (or any number of items) will be mixed in 1 second.
